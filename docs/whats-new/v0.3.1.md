## Prolog Class Enhancements

### Mandatory Keyword Arguments

::: warning
This change may break your code.
:::

Some keyword arguments such as `catcherrors` used to be passable as positional arguments.
For instance the following was valid:
```python
Prolog.assertz("big(airplane)", False)
```

Starting with v0.3.1, it is mandatory to pass arguments such as `catcherrors` as keyword arguments:
```python
Prolog.assertz("big(airplane)", catcherrors=False)
```

### Multiple terms for Prolog.dynamic

Updated `Prolog.dynamic` to accept one ore more terms:
```python
Prolog.dynamic("mother/1", "father/1")
```

## Prolog.consult Enhancements

### Tilde character in paths are expanded to the user home directory

```python
Prolog.consult("~/my_files/hanoi.pl")
# consults file /home/me/my_files/hanoi.pl
```

### Both strings and pathlib.Path objects are allowed as paths

```python
from pathlib import Path
Prolog.consult(Path("myfile.pl"))
# equivalent to:
Prolog.consult("myfile.pl")
```

### Added relative_to keyword argument

`relative_to` keyword argument makes it easier to construct the consult path.
This keyword is no-op, if the consult path is absolute.

If the given `relative_to` path is a file, then the consult path is updated to become a sibling of that path.
Assume you have the `/home/me/project/facts.pl` that you want to consult from the `run.py` file which exists in the same directory `/home/me/project`.
Using the built-in `__file__` constant which contains the path of the current Python file , it becomes very easy to do that:
```python
# in run.py
Prolog.consult("facts.pl", relative_to=__file__)
```

If the given `relative_path` is a directory, then the consult path is updated to become a child of that path.
```python
project_dir = "~/projects"
Prolog.consult("facts1.pl", relative_to=project_dir)
Prolog.consult("facts2.pl", relative_to=project_dir)
```

Symbolic links are not yet supported yet.
